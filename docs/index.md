# Intune Assignments Manager

An enterprise tool for bulk-managing Microsoft Intune mobile app and configuration profile assignments. Browse your tenant's apps and policies, assign them to Azure AD groups in bulk, and audit every change -- all from a single browser-based interface.

The app runs entirely client-side. Your credentials and data never leave your browser except to communicate directly with the Microsoft Graph API. Deploy it to Cloudflare Pages or run it locally.

## What it does

Intune Assignments Manager connects to your Microsoft 365 tenant via the Microsoft Graph API and provides:

- **Unified browsing** of all mobile apps and Settings Catalog configuration profiles in your Intune tenant
- **Bulk assignment** of multiple apps and profiles to multiple Azure AD groups in a single operation
- **Conflict detection** when the same group is targeted with different assignment settings
- **Safe merging** of new assignments with existing ones (the Graph API replaces all assignments on each POST, so the app always fetches current state first)
- **CSV workflows** for exporting current assignments and importing new ones
- **Audit visibility** into recent assignment-related changes in your tenant
- **Deployment monitoring** for app install and profile deployment failures

All operations use the Microsoft Graph `beta` endpoint and require appropriate Intune administrator permissions.
